#demo

New github repo for hackathon 2023
App has been developed in Completely Python Platforms

for Frontends: QtDesigner has been used
for Backends : PyQt5 has been used

challenges:
1. at first, Qt5 doesn't support python 3.11.0 which is the latest version of python and widely being used.
2.the Optimization for Qt designer along with version to version in several devices are a bit shaky and buggy.
3. adding images in Qt designer created some certain problems while performing git oprations.
4. extracting files from file and then implementing on Qt Designer created a problem  but we found an alternative way to solve it.

Solutions:
1. We had to downgrade the python to even start developing the project
2. we  had to work around with those Qtdesginer features all along the project
3. We used an alternative way without involving qrc files and used OpenCV library
